# vertx-load-balancer
An old example on how to write a very simple load balancer using Vert.x (v 3.2)

If you are interested in writing load balancers or proxies with Vert.x, you may want to use [the HTTP Proxy](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-http-proxy/java/) that uses Vert.x v4 or draw inspiration from it.
